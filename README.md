AI-Based Emergency Department Flow Optimization System
Project Overview
This project explores how Artificial Intelligence can be used to improve patient flow management in hospital Emergency Departments, focusing on operational efficiency rather than clinical decision-making.
The system is designed as a digital operations assistant to help hospitals reduce overcrowding, waiting times, and trolley congestion.

Project Aim
To design and prototype an AI-driven operational intelligence system that:
•	Improves Emergency Department patient flow
•	Reduces waiting and trolley times
•	Optimizes bed allocation
•	Supports clinical staff by reducing administrative workload

Key Challenges Addressed
•	Emergency department overcrowding
•	Long waiting times for investigations and admission
•	Delayed bed allocation
•	Manual coordination between departments

Core System Components
1. Patient Flow Prediction
•	Predicts length of stay in ED
•	Estimates admission vs discharge likelihood
•	Identifies high-risk prolonged waiting cases
2. Bottleneck Detection
•	Detects delays in:
o	Radiology
o	Laboratory investigations
o	Specialist reviews
o	Bed assignment
3. Intelligent Bed Management
•	Predicts near-term bed availability
•	Detects delayed discharges
•	Suggests optimal admission pathways
4. Automated Alerts & Coordination
•	Automated alerts to departments
•	Escalation if delays exceed thresholds
5. Real-Time Operational Dashboard
Displays:
•	ED occupancy
•	Waiting times by triage level
•	Trolley patient count
•	Predicted bed availability

Data Used
•	Simulated or anonymised hospital operational data
•	No clinical or patient-identifiable data used

Technology Stack
•	Python
•	Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)
•	Pandas, NumPy
•	Machine Learning (classification & forecasting models)
•	Streamlit dashboard
•	Data visualisation libraries


Ethics & Governance
•	No clinical decisions made by AI
•	Advisory-only recommendations
•	GDPR-compliant design
•	Transparent and explainable models

Expected Outcomes
•	Reduced ED waiting times
•	Improved bed turnaround
•	Lower trolley patient numbers
•	Improved patient experience
